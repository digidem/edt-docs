# First steps

Make sure you have a device which was previously setup with the Earth Defenders Offline Toolkit.&#x20;

Connect the device to the power supply and make sure device is turned on by checking lights blinking.

After a couple of minutes verify WiFi hotspot appears on user devices. Connect to hotspot and open captive portal (for desktop, captive-portal may not show).

Finally, with the portal open, copy the provided url, open your preferred browser, paste the url and load the page. You're ready to start exploring.

If some content isn't showing up it might be that you're device hasn't synchronized content yet. For that you'll need to connect the device to the Internet, get in touch with us, and we'll allow your device to synchronize content with the Earth Defenders Toolkit Cloud.
