# Syncing content

The Earth Defenders Offline Toolkit comes with an instance of [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) running, usually on the address: [http://edt.local:8082](http://edt.local:8082)

The first time a device is connected itâ€™ll send a request to Earth Defenders Toolkit Cloud to start syncing content. Get the ID from the the local Offline Toolkit Syncthing instance:

Get in touch with us on [support.md](../../support.md "mention")and send along your Syncthing ID along with other information.

Once we authorize syncing from the EDT Cloud the local Offline Toolkit should start displaying syncing information:

Syncing can take a while because it's a few gigabytes of content. Once that's done, all content should be ready for offline use.
