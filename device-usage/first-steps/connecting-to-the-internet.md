# Connecting to the internet

The recomended and easiest way to connect any Offline Toolkit device to the Internet is through ethernet cable, directly from the router to the device.

Your device can connect to a local WiFi hotspot in order to gain access to the internet, but this feature hasn't been well tested as of yet.

To test it out go to the admin panel, and to the **Networking** tab, usually located at:  [http://edt.local:8079/#/networking](http://edt.local:8079/#/networking)

The device will scan for nearby wifi hotspots. You can then select the one to connect to, enter the password and connect.
