# Content syncronization

Somtimes we want to keep data syncronized between devices, such as for having shared documents across different devices, and across for everyone in a team. For that we use the same application used for [syncing-content.md](../first-steps/syncing-content.md "mention"), Syncthing: It's usually running on the address: [http://edt.local:8082](http://edt.local:8082)

We can start by adding a folder from our community cloud:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Add a descriptive label to the new folder. The content directory is named `/config` here, so find your folder under it.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled 3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Before clicking save, go to the **Advanced** tab. Change the **Folder Type** according to your needs.

For the cloud, **Send Only** is worth selecting, as most times we want a single source of truth for the content

Finally we can click save.
