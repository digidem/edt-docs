# Syncing with Hub

First connect to the Offline Toolkit's WiFi hotspot, or to a wifi network that it's also connected too.

Open Mapeo and enter the sync page. Check [documentation on Mapeo sync](https://docs.mapeo.app/complete-reference-guide/mapeo-mobile-use/wifi-sync).

You should see the Offline Toolkit device showing up and ready to sync.

If not you might need to change your project key. In case you don't have an existing project, download and use the custom Mapeo configuration that's provided, which comes preset with the same project key as the Hub.

If you already have a custom project key check [customization.md](customization.md "mention") to learn how to set the correct key for the Mapeo Data Hub to work for your team.
