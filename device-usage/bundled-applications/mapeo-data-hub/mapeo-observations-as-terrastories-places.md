# Mapeo Observations as Terrastories Places

On the configuration file included with the Offline Toolkit there's a Terrastories category. Every observation marked with it will be processed by the Mapeo Data Hub and placed on a csv file formatted for Terrastories.

Once imported into Terrastories, the obversations will be available as Places, and ready to be used to link to Stories and Speakers.
