# Customization

You're project might have a secret key already setup, and so your Mapeo device isn't able to find the Mapeo Hub locally.

Check [customizing-experience.md](../../customizing-experience.md "mention")for instructions on how to change variables.

You can change project key for Mapeo: `MAPEO_PROJECT_KEY`

Add your projects key which can be obtained from the Mapeo sync screen.

Change Mapeo category that Terrastories place's will be collected from: `MAPEO_TERRASTORIES_TYPE`

Every observation of that category will be included in the csv with Story Places for Terrastories to import.
