# Storing locally

The Offline Toolkit provides a storage space for community data. Besides the administrator, all other content is public.

The first step is creating a new account for yourself. You'll need to memorize your name and password.

Once logged in you'll have acces to the public space for storing files. Create a personal or team folder and store your files inside.

Be mindful of storage space as there are limits to how much the device can hold. Check [managing-device.md](../../managing-device.md "mention") to learn how to check storage space.
