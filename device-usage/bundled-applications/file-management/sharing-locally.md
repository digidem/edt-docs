# Sharing locally

Everyone loggede to the community cloud has access to all folders. But in case you want to share a file with someone who isn't part of the community through the local network, you can use the **Share** functionality of the file browsing application.

Select the duration of the share, and if a password is needed, and finally click Share:

Copy the address and share it through other means such as a chat app.
