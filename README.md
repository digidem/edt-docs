# Introduction

The reality of many communities is that Internet connectivity is unreliable, or non existent. For that reason [Earth Defenders Toolkit](https://earthdefenderstoolkit.com/) can be deployed to computers on the ground so that all content can live offline, in a local network, and can be synced whenever the device goes online.

A computer running EDT offline creates a hotspot, where people with devices in wifi range can download, install, and use applications curated on the Earths Defenderâ€™s Toolkit platform. We've organized content around topics such as **community mapping** and **land-based storytelling**. For each of these topics we provide guides, use cases, assets and helper applications, which are made available through a simple interface.

On the local network, community members have access to applications for storing and sharing their content. The featured tool **Terrastories** can also be used locally.
