# Introduction

The reality of many communities is that Internet connectivity is unreliable, or non existent. For that reason [Earth Defenders Toolkit](https://earthdefenderstoolkit.com/) can be deployed to computers on the ground so that all content can live offline, in a local network, and can be synced whenever the device goes online.

A computer running EDT offline creates a hotspot, where community members in wifi range can download and install applications listed at the Earths Defenderâ€™s Kit platform such as Mapeo and Terrastories, and also explore guides and read use cases in different languages.

On the local network community members also have access to applications for storing their content locally, as well as sharing or sync it, locally or through the Internet.
