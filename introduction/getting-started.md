# Getting started

To start using Earth Defenders Toolkit Offline you'll need to setup a computer. Head to the [Device setup](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M-REAqni3AWTbFjPye3/s/QezzY4k6FoxghGoX9f5G/\~/changes/7/device-setup/introduction) section to understand how this works.

If your team lacks the necessary technical skills to setup your own device, please get in touch with our team at Digital Democracy so we can assist you on choosing the best path to deploy a device for your community or organization.

Write to us at [info@earthdefenderstoolkit.com](mailto:info@earthdefenderstoolkit.com) or go through our [inquiry form](https://forms.gle/uvK5cZQPi4YQCof67) which can help us find out more about your needs.

For help with common technical issues, see the section of the [Earth Defenders Toolkit Offline guide](http://demo.earthdefenderstoolkit.com:8086/). For additional support, please check out the community of active users and maintainers of EDT on our public Discord, Telegram group and online forum.
