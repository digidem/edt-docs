# FAQ

**Does my community or organization have full control and ownership over data stored on an EDT Offline device?**

That is only true if you're [deploying EDT Offline using Docker](../../device-setup/device-setup/using-docker.md), as we're currently relying on [Balena Cloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud), which gives the Balena team backdoors to any device. We have plans to shift to using [Open Balena](https://www.balena.io/open), which will remove those backdoors for the Balena organization.

**Can I install EDT Offline in any computer?**

Yes, there are two ways of installing EDT Offline in a computer, but both require some technical knowledge in either formating a computer or running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
