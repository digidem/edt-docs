# Choosing a device

There are a multitude of different boards that can be used to run EDT Offline. From recycled hardware, such as old computers to tiny, low-power single-board-computers.

Some important things to pay attention when choosing the right device:

* Ease to setup (single-board-computers are always easier)
* Price, including power supply, storage, case, etc.
* WiFi range and capacity
* Energy usage
* Power
* Availability
* Form factor

#### Easiest to setup, but more expensive and less CPU and WiFi power

Single-board-computers are the easiest to setup. Weâ€™ve tested on the Raspberry Pi 4 and Rock Pi 4, and had great results. The Raspberry 3 should be able to handle as well, but we havenâ€™t tested yet.

For all these boards it's a question of downloading the latest release from the [Github repository](https://github.com/digidem/edt-offline/releases/latest), and burning them to an class 10 micr-sdcard using a software such as [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher).

**Recommended: Rock Pi 4 B+**

We recommend the [**Rock Pi 4 B+**](https://rockpi.org/rockpi4) board because of the chip shortages around the globe resulting in a scarcity of the Raspberry Pi boards.

Besides the board itself youâ€™ll need some cooling, as the boards tend to overheat without appropriate cooling system.

Youâ€™ll also need a power supply in case it isnâ€™t included with the board, and itâ€™s important that itâ€™s a USB C 5v with at least 3A.

And finally youâ€™ll need a storage, which should be at least class 10 micro-sd card.

#### Cheap, powerful CPU and WiFi, but harder to setup

![Zimaboard with PCI express Wifi module](<../.gitbook/assets/zimaboard\_wifi (1).jpg>)

Any old desktop of notebook can serve as an EDT Offline device, but theyâ€™re a bit harder to setup, and they usually require entering the computerâ€™s BIOS and change some settings to set USB as primary device to boot from. That will require are least a key board and a screen, and appropriate cables to connect to it.

After changing the BIOS settings, youâ€™ll need to burn the amd64 image from the [release page](https://github.com/digidem/edt-offline/releases/latest), and burn it to a thumb drive with enough storage.

Turn the device off, insert the thumb drive, and turn it back on. This process can take minutes and might require a few restarts, but once finished will have a fully working EDT Offline instance.

If youâ€™re buying a computer to use with EDT Offline, we recommend mini-pcs such as the [Intel Nuc](https://www.intel.com.br/content/www/br/pt/products/details/nuc.html).

**Recommended:** [**ZimaBoard**](https://www.zimaboard.com/)

Itâ€™s one of the cheapest boards you can get, with the smallest form-factor. Itâ€™s PCI express port makes it easy to plug different WiFi adapters, which will depend on how fast you want the connection to be, how many people it can handle at the same time and how far you need your WiFi hotspot to go.

#### Single Board Computers

Because they usually use ARM cpus they tend to be consume less energy and have a smaller form-factor, but are less capable, and don't usually include storage, casing or a cooling system
